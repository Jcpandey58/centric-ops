🚀 URL Exposure Made Easy
You no longer need to open PowerShell and type commands manually.
Just double-click the https.bat file — and boom 💥, your URL is exposed to the internet instantly.

📋 Centralized Logging
Previously, logs were split across multiple files like:

batfilechanges.log, cmd.log, etc...

Now, all logs are streamlined into a single file:
Logs/ExposeUrl.log
This simplifies error tracking and debugging.

💾 Database Backup Script Added
A new PowerShell script has been added for backing up the C8 database:
📄 Script Location: Steps/DB_backup.ps1
📁 Backup Output: Stored in C:\Db Backup with a timestamped filename.
Just run the script and your backup will be ready automatically.
